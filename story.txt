Once Upon a time in the city of Munich, there a lived a great club, her name Fc Bayern Munchen.
She was the most feared and most wettbewerbsfaehig. 
She could drop a beat hotter than Rammstein.
Bayern was known for wearing black lederhose in the summer but wouldn't be caught dead in a dirndel.
Most importantly Bayern was the three time Bratwurst eating contest champion.
She was the kind of gauss who could eat a brot in a single bite.
